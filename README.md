# scaling-pixel-canvas
A dynamic 2D pixel canvas and basic sprite system that scales responsively.

## Abstract

Someone on my team posted the notion that a 2D graphics pipeline would be moderately easy to build using a grid of squares. I suspected this would be an incredibly expensive way to paint pixels on screen, but the idea was amusing and I like abusing canvases.

So, this is just a fun experiment, although it works better than I would have thought.
